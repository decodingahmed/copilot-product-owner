# Feature 12: AI Learning Personalization

**Epic:** [02-ai-assisted-task-planning](../epics/02-ai-assisted-task-planning.md)
**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** Low
**Estimated Effort:** M
**Assigned To:** TBD
**Dependencies:** [08-ai-task-breakdown-engine](08-ai-task-breakdown-engine.md), [11-contextual-task-suggestions](11-contextual-task-suggestions.md)

## Description

Implement machine learning system that continuously learns from user interactions, preferences, and feedback to personalize AI assistance. The system adapts task breakdown styles, suggestion frequency, and planning approaches to match individual user preferences and workflows.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a** bullet journal user
**I want** the AI to learn and adapt to my personal style
**So that** suggestions become more relevant and helpful over time

### Additional User Stories
1. **As a** detailed planner, **I want** AI to learn I prefer comprehensive breakdowns, **so that** suggestions match my planning depth
2. **As a** minimalist, **I want** AI to learn I prefer simple suggestions, **so that** I'm not overwhelmed with options
3. **As a** feedback provider, **I want** to see how my input improves the system, **so that** I feel motivated to train it
4. **As a** privacy-conscious user, **I want** control over what data is used for learning, **so that** I maintain privacy

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] System learns from user acceptance/rejection patterns of AI suggestions
- [ ] Personalization adapts task breakdown complexity based on user preferences
- [ ] Learning system respects user privacy settings and data preferences
- [ ] Performance improves measurably over 30-day usage period
- [ ] User can view and understand how personalization affects their experience
- [ ] Ability to reset or adjust learning parameters
- [ ] Transparent explanation of what data is used for learning
- [ ] Option to export personal AI model preferences

## Technical Details

### Learning Architecture
```javascript
UserPersonalizationProfile {
  userId: string,
  learningMetrics: {
    suggestionAcceptanceRate: number,
    preferredBreakdownComplexity: 'simple' | 'detailed' | 'comprehensive',
    optimalSuggestionFrequency: number,
    preferredTaskCategories: string[],
    timePatterns: object
  },
  feedbackHistory: FeedbackEvent[],
  modelWeights: object,
  lastUpdated: Date
}

FeedbackEvent {
  type: 'accepted' | 'rejected' | 'modified',
  aiSuggestionId: string,
  userAction: object,
  timestamp: Date,
  context: object
}
```

### Privacy Controls
```javascript
PrivacySettings {
  enableLearning: boolean,
  shareAnonymizedData: boolean,
  retentionPeriod: number,
  excludeCategories: string[]
}
```

## Definition of Done
