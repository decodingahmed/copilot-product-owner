# Feature 20: Intelligent Future Event Detection

**Epic:** [04-future-planning-calendar-integration](../epics/04-future-planning-calendar-integration.md)
**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** L
**Assigned To:** TBD
**Dependencies:** [03-daily-log-management](03-daily-log-management.md)

## Description

Implement AI system that proactively identifies future events, deadlines, and commitments from journal entries, calendar integration, and user patterns. This solves the core problem of losing track of future obligations by surfacing them at the right time for planning.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a** bullet journal user who loses track of future events
**I want** AI to identify and remind me of upcoming commitments
**So that** I never miss important events or forget to prepare for them

### Additional User Stories
1. **As a** busy professional, **I want** meeting preparation reminders, **so that** I'm always ready for important discussions
2. **As a** social person, **I want** birthday and anniversary detection, **so that** I never forget to celebrate important people
3. **As a** traveler, **I want** travel preparation suggestions, **so that** I can plan and pack effectively
4. **As a** planner, **I want** lead-time recommendations for different event types, **so that** I prepare with appropriate timing

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AI scans journal entries for date mentions and future commitments
- [ ] Automatic detection of birthdays, anniversaries, and recurring events
- [ ] Integration with calendar systems to identify upcoming events
- [ ] Intelligent lead-time suggestions for different event types (meetings, travel, deadlines)
- [ ] Proactive surfacing of events during daily planning sessions
- [ ] Customizable notification timing for different event categories
- [ ] Event categorization (work, personal, social, travel) with appropriate preparation templates
- [ ] Learning from user patterns to improve detection accuracy

## Technical Details

### Event Detection Engine
```javascript
DetectedEvent {
  id: string,
  userId: string,
  eventType: 'meeting' | 'deadline' | 'birthday' | 'travel' | 'appointment' | 'other',
  title: string,
  date: Date,
  source: 'journal_entry' | 'calendar' | 'user_input',
  confidence: number,
  preparationLeadTime: number, // days before event
  preparationTasks: string[],
  status: 'detected' | 'confirmed' | 'dismissed'
}

EventPattern {
  eventType: string,
  keywords: string[],
  datePatterns: RegExp[],
  defaultLeadTime: number,
  preparationTemplate: string[]
}
```

### APIs/Endpoints
```
GET /api/events/detected - Get detected future events
POST /api/events/confirm - Confirm detected event
POST /api/events/dismiss - Dismiss false positive
GET /api/events/preparation/{id} - Get preparation suggestions for event
