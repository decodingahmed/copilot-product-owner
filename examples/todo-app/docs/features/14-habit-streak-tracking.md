# Feature 14: Habit Streak Tracking

**Epic:** [03-progress-tracking-visualization](../epics/03-progress-tracking-visualization.md)
**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** M
**Assigned To:** TBD
**Dependencies:** [03-daily-log-management](03-daily-log-management.md)

## Description

Implement comprehensive habit tracking with streak visualization that motivates users through daily incremental progress display. This feature transforms routine bullet journal habit tracking into an engaging, visual experience that celebrates consistency and helps users build lasting positive behaviors.

The system balances motivation through streak preservation with healthy approaches to habit formation that don't create anxiety around "perfect" streaks.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a** habit-focused bullet journal user
**I want** to see my daily habit streaks visualized clearly
**So that** I stay motivated to maintain consistent positive behaviors

### Additional User Stories
1. **As a** visual learner, **I want** colorful streak calendars and progress charts, **so that** I can quickly see my habit patterns
2. **As a** perfectionist, **I want** streak recovery and "grace period" options, **so that** missing one day doesn't destroy my motivation
3. **As a** goal-setter, **I want** habit streak milestones and celebrations, **so that** I feel rewarded for consistency
4. **As a** data-conscious person, **I want** habit statistics and trends, **so that** I can understand my behavior patterns better

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Visual streak counter displays current streak for each habit prominently
- [ ] Calendar heat map shows habit completion patterns over time
- [ ] Streak recovery options help users get back on track after missing days
- [ ] Milestone achievements celebrate significant streak accomplishments (7, 30, 100 days, etc.)
- [ ] Multiple streak types supported (daily, weekly, custom frequency)
- [ ] Habit completion can be logged with different intensity levels or notes
- [ ] Historical streak data is preserved and visualized
- [ ] Streaks sync across devices in real-time
- [ ] Export functionality for habit data analysis

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- Time-series database design optimized for habit tracking queries
- Real-time streak calculation with efficient caching
- Background processing for streak maintenance and milestone detection
- Flexible habit definition system supporting various frequencies and goals

### APIs/Endpoints
```
POST /api/habits - Create new habit tracking
PUT /api/habits/{id} - Update habit definition or settings
DELETE /api/habits/{id} - Remove habit (preserves historical data)
POST /api/habits/{id}/log - Log habit completion for specific date
GET /api/habits/{id}/streaks - Get current and historical streak data
GET /api/habits/{id}/stats - Get comprehensive habit statistics
```

### Data Model
```javascript
Habit {
  id: string,
  userId: string,
  name: string,
  description: string,
  frequency: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'custom',
  targetDays: number[], // for weekly habits: [1,3,5] for Mon/Wed/Fri
  createdDate: Date,
  isActive: boolean,
  category: string,
  color: string,
  icon: string
}

HabitLog {
  id: string,
  habitId: string,
  date: Date,
  completed: boolean,
  intensity?: number, // 1-5 scale for partial completion
  notes?: string,
  timestamp: Date
}

StreakData {
  habitId: string,
  currentStreak: number,
  longestStreak: number,
  streakStartDate: Date,
  totalCompletions: number,
  completionRate: number,
  milestones: Milestone[]
}
```

## UI/UX Considerations

**Habit Dashboard:**
- Grid layout showing all habits with current streak prominently displayed
- Quick-tap completion for today's habits
- Visual indicators for habit status (completed, pending, overdue)
- Swipe gestures for quick actions (complete, skip, edit)

**Streak Visualization:**
- Calendar heat map similar to GitHub contribution graph
- Line charts showing streak progression over time
- Circular progress indicators for weekly/monthly goals
- Achievement badges for milestone celebrations

**Motivation Features:**
- Positive reinforcement messages for streak maintenance
- Gentle encouragement for streak recovery after breaks
- Visual celebrations for milestone achievements
- Progress sharing capabilities for social motivation

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for streak calculation algorithms with edge cases
- [ ] Integration tests for habit logging and data persistence
- [ ] E2E tests for complete habit creation and tracking workflows
- [ ] Performance tests for large datasets (years of habit data)
- [ ] Time zone testing for accurate day boundaries
- [ ] Data migration testing for habit definition changes

## Dependencies

**Technical Dependencies:**
- Daily log management system for integration with bullet journal entries
- Time zone handling infrastructure for accurate day calculations
- Push notification system for habit reminders
- Data visualization library for charts and calendars

**Feature Dependencies:**
- Must be completed after: [03-daily-log-management](03-daily-log-management.md)
- Integrates with: [15-goal-progress-dashboard](15-goal-progress-dashboard.md)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code complete and reviewed
- [ ] Streak calculations accurate across time zones and DST changes
- [ ] Visual elements render correctly on all supported devices
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met for loading large habit histories
- [ ] Habit data export functionality working
- [ ] Milestone achievement system functional
- [ ] Cross-platform synchronization verified
- [ ] User acceptance testing with habit enthusiasts completed
- [ ] Accessibility compliance for color-blind users verified

## Notes

**Behavioral Psychology Considerations:**
- Research shows that streaks can be motivating but also create anxiety
- Implement "streak freezes" or "grace periods" for sustainable habit formation
- Focus on progress over perfection in messaging and visualization
- Consider habit stacking suggestions for building routine connections

**Gamification Balance:**
- Celebrate achievements without creating unhealthy competition with self
- Provide multiple success metrics beyond just streaks
- Include trend analysis to show progress even during difficult periods
- Allow users to reset or modify habits without losing all historical data

**Future Enhancements:**
- Habit correlation analysis (which habits support each other)
- Seasonal pattern recognition and suggestions
- Integration with wearable devices for automatic habit detection
- Social features for accountability partners and community challenges
