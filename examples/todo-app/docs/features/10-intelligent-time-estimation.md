# Feature 10: Intelligent Time Estimation

**Epic:** [02-ai-assisted-task-planning](../epics/02-ai-assisted-task-planning.md)
**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** M
**Assigned To:** TBD
**Dependencies:** [08-ai-task-breakdown-engine](08-ai-task-breakdown-engine.md)

## Description

Implement AI-powered time estimation for tasks and sub-tasks, learning from user patterns and historical data to provide increasingly accurate duration predictions. This helps users plan their days more realistically and understand their productivity patterns.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a** bullet journal user
**I want** AI to suggest realistic time estimates for my tasks
**So that** I can plan my day more effectively and avoid overcommitting

### Additional User Stories
1. **As a** chronic underestimator, **I want** AI to learn my actual completion times, **so that** estimates become more accurate over time
2. **As a** scheduler, **I want** confidence levels on estimates, **so that** I can plan buffer time for uncertain tasks
3. **As a** productive person, **I want** estimates to consider my energy levels throughout the day, **so that** I can schedule tasks optimally
4. **As a** learner, **I want** to see estimation accuracy feedback, **so that** I can improve my own planning skills

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AI provides time estimates for individual tasks and task breakdowns
- [ ] Estimates improve over time based on user's actual completion data
- [ ] Confidence levels indicate reliability of estimates (high, medium, low)
- [ ] Time-of-day recommendations based on user productivity patterns
- [ ] Estimation accuracy tracking and feedback display
- [ ] Buffer time suggestions for complex or uncertain tasks
- [ ] Category-based estimation learning (work vs personal vs creative tasks)
- [ ] Integration with daily planning and scheduling features

## Technical Details

### Machine Learning Model
```javascript
EstimationModel {
  userId: string,
  taskCategory: string,
  taskComplexity: number,
  userHistoricalData: CompletionData[],
  timeOfDayFactors: object,
  estimatedMinutes: number,
  confidenceLevel: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low',
  bufferRecommendation: number
}

CompletionData {
  taskDescription: string,
  estimatedTime: number,
  actualTime: number,
  timeOfDay: Date,
  dayOfWeek: number,
  completionDate: Date
}
```

### APIs/Endpoints
```
POST /api/estimation/predict - Get time estimate for task
POST /api/estimation/feedback - Record actual completion time
GET /api/estimation/accuracy - Get estimation accuracy stats
GET /api/estimation/patterns - Get user productivity patterns
```
