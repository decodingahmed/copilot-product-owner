2. **As a** reflective person, **I want** to understand why tasks weren't completed, **so that** I can improve my planning
3. **As a** busy person, **I want** bulk migration options, **so that** I can quickly organize multiple tasks
4. **As a** goal-focused person, **I want** migration to preserve task context and priority, **so that** important items don't lose significance
