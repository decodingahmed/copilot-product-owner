# Feature 02: Rapid Logging Interface

**Epic:** [01-core-bullet-journal-infrastructure](../epics/01-core-bullet-journal-infrastructure.md)
**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** L
**Assigned To:** TBD
**Dependencies:** [01-user-authentication-system](01-user-authentication-system.md)

## Description

Create the core rapid logging interface that allows users to quickly capture tasks, events, and notes using traditional bullet journal symbols and modern digital enhancements. This is the heart of the bullet journaling experience and must feel as fast and natural as writing with pen and paper.

The interface supports both traditional bullet journal symbols (•, -, *, etc.) and provides smart input assistance while maintaining the speed and simplicity that makes bullet journaling effective.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a** bullet journal user
**I want** to quickly log tasks, events, and notes with traditional symbols
**So that** I can capture thoughts and commitments without breaking my flow

### Additional User Stories
1. **As a** mobile user, **I want** voice-to-text rapid logging, **so that** I can capture entries hands-free
2. **As a** traditional bullet journalist, **I want** familiar symbols and shortcuts, **so that** the digital experience feels natural
3. **As a** busy professional, **I want** smart auto-complete for common entries, **so that** I can log faster than handwriting
4. **As a** visual person, **I want** clear symbol recognition and formatting, **so that** my logs are easy to scan and understand

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Support for all standard bullet journal symbols: • (task), - (event), * (note), ! (important), ? (idea)
- [ ] Quick symbol picker accessible with one tap/click
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for power users (e.g., typing "• " auto-formats as task)
- [ ] Voice-to-text input with automatic symbol detection
- [ ] Smart auto-complete based on user's historical entries
- [ ] Entry timestamps automatically captured but displayed optionally
- [ ] Entries can be quickly edited, reordered, or deleted
- [ ] Visual distinction between different entry types (color, formatting, icons)
- [ ] Support for entry tags and categories
- [ ] Quick entry mode accessible from anywhere in the app

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- Component-based input system with pluggable symbol processors
- Real-time text processing for symbol recognition and formatting
- Local database storage with efficient text search capabilities
- Voice recognition integration with offline fallback options

### APIs/Endpoints
```
POST /api/entries - Create new journal entry
PUT /api/entries/{id} - Update existing entry
DELETE /api/entries/{id} - Delete entry
GET /api/entries/suggestions - Get auto-complete suggestions based on input
POST /api/entries/voice - Process voice-to-text input
```

### Data Model
```javascript
Entry {
  id: string,
  userId: string,
  type: 'task' | 'event' | 'note' | 'important' | 'idea',
  content: string,
  symbol: string,
  tags: string[],
  timestamp: Date,
  dailyLogId: string,
  metadata: {
    completed: boolean,
    migrated: boolean,
    priority: number,
    estimatedTime: number
  }
}
```

## UI/UX Considerations

**Input Flow:**
1. User taps "+" or uses quick-add gesture
2. Symbol picker appears with common symbols highlighted
3. Text input appears with smart formatting as user types
4. Auto-complete suggestions appear for known patterns
5. Entry saved automatically with timestamp

**Visual Design:**
- Clean, minimal interface mimicking paper journal aesthetics
- Clear visual hierarchy with symbol-based color coding
- Smooth animations for entry creation and editing
- Accessibility-compliant color contrast and text sizing
- Dark mode support for evening journaling

**Mobile Optimizations:**
- Large touch targets for easy finger navigation
- Swipe gestures for quick entry management
- Voice input button prominently placed
- Keyboard optimization with custom symbol row

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for symbol recognition and text processing
- [ ] Integration tests for voice-to-text functionality
- [ ] E2E tests for complete rapid logging workflows
- [ ] Performance tests for large numbers of entries
- [ ] Accessibility tests for screen readers and keyboard navigation
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility testing (iOS, Android, Web)

## Dependencies

**Technical Dependencies:**
- User authentication system must be complete
- Basic data storage and sync infrastructure
- Voice recognition API integration

**Feature Dependencies:**
- Must be completed before: [03-daily-log-management](03-daily-log-management.md)
- Blocks: Most other core journaling features

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code complete and reviewed
- [ ] All symbol types working correctly
- [ ] Voice input functional on all platforms
- [ ] Auto-complete suggestions accurate and fast
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (sub-100ms input response)
- [ ] Cross-platform testing complete
- [ ] Accessibility compliance verified
- [ ] User acceptance testing passed
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

**Design Inspiration:**
- Study successful bullet journal apps like Notion, Obsidian, and dedicated BuJo apps
- Analyze analog bullet journal workflows for digital adaptation opportunities
- Consider integration with popular note-taking patterns

**Future Enhancements:**
- Handwriting recognition for stylus input
- Custom symbol creation and management
- Template-based rapid entry for recurring patterns
- Integration with external dictation services
