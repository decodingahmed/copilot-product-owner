# Feature 09: Natural Language Task Entry

**Epic:** [02-ai-assisted-task-planning](../epics/02-ai-assisted-task-planning.md)
**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** L
**Assigned To:** TBD
**Dependencies:** [02-rapid-logging-interface](02-rapid-logging-interface.md)

## Description

Enable natural language processing for quick task entry, allowing users to type or speak tasks in conversational language that gets automatically parsed into structured bullet journal entries with appropriate symbols, dates, and context.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a** busy bullet journal user
**I want** to quickly enter tasks using natural language
**So that** I can capture thoughts without worrying about formatting

### Additional User Stories
1. **As a** voice user, **I want** to dictate tasks naturally, **so that** I can log while driving or walking
2. **As a** quick thinker, **I want** smart date parsing, **so that** "call mom tomorrow" automatically schedules correctly
3. **As a** context switcher, **I want** automatic symbol detection, **so that** "meeting with John" becomes an event automatically
4. **As a** detail-oriented person, **I want** to refine AI suggestions, **so that** I maintain control over my entries

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Natural language parsing for common task formats
- [ ] Automatic date extraction and scheduling (today, tomorrow, next week, etc.)
- [ ] Intelligent symbol assignment based on context (meeting → event, buy → task)
- [ ] Voice-to-text integration with offline capability
- [ ] Smart time estimation based on task description
- [ ] Priority detection from language cues (urgent, important, ASAP)
- [ ] Tag extraction from natural language descriptions
- [ ] Correction and refinement interface for AI suggestions

## Technical Details

### NLP Processing Pipeline
```javascript
// Input: "Call mom tomorrow at 3pm about birthday plans"
// Output: {
//   type: 'task',
//   content: 'Call mom about birthday plans',
//   scheduledDate: '2025-10-30',
//   scheduledTime: '15:00',
//   tags: ['family', 'birthday'],
//   priority: 'normal'
// }
```

### APIs/Endpoints
```
POST /api/nlp/parse-entry - Parse natural language input
POST /api/nlp/voice-to-text - Convert speech to text
