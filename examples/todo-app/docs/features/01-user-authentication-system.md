# Feature 01: User Authentication System

**Epic:** [01-core-bullet-journal-infrastructure](../epics/01-core-bullet-journal-infrastructure.md)
**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** M
**Assigned To:** TBD
**Dependencies:** None (Foundation feature)

## Description

Implement secure user authentication and account management system that protects personal bullet journal data while providing seamless access across devices. The system must balance security with ease of use, ensuring users can quickly access their daily journaling without friction.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a** bullet journal user
**I want** secure access to my personal journal data
**So that** my thoughts and tasks remain private while being accessible across my devices

### Additional User Stories
1. **As a** privacy-conscious user, **I want** my data encrypted and secure, **so that** my personal information is protected
2. **As a** mobile user, **I want** biometric login options, **so that** I can access my journal quickly and securely
3. **As a** forgetful user, **I want** easy password recovery, **so that** I never lose access to my journal history
4. **As a** multi-device user, **I want** seamless sync across platforms, **so that** I can journal on any device

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Email/password registration and login functionality
- [ ] Biometric authentication (fingerprint, Face ID) on supported devices
- [ ] Password reset via email with secure token validation
- [ ] Multi-device session management with logout capabilities
- [ ] End-to-end encryption for sensitive journal data
- [ ] Account deletion with complete data removal option
- [ ] Session timeout and re-authentication for security
- [ ] OAuth integration with Google/Apple for convenience

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- JWT-based authentication with refresh token rotation
- Bcrypt password hashing with salt
- End-to-end encryption for journal entries
- Secure session management with device tracking

### APIs/Endpoints
```
POST /api/auth/register - User registration
POST /api/auth/login - User login
POST /api/auth/refresh - Token refresh
POST /api/auth/logout - User logout
POST /api/auth/reset-password - Password reset request
POST /api/auth/confirm-reset - Password reset confirmation
DELETE /api/auth/account - Account deletion
```

### Data Model
```javascript
User {
  id: string,
  email: string,
  passwordHash: string,
  createdAt: Date,
  lastLoginAt: Date,
  isVerified: boolean,
  encryptionKey: string,
  preferences: object
}
```
