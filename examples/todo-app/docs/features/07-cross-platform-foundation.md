**Epic:** [01-core-bullet-journal-infrastructure](../epics/01-core-bullet-journal-infrastructure.md)
**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** L
**Assigned To:** TBD
**Dependencies:** None (Foundation feature)

## Description

Establish cross-platform development foundation ensuring consistent user experience across iOS, Android, and web platforms. This foundation supports the bullet journaling workflow across all user devices and contexts.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a** multi-device user
**I want** consistent bullet journal experience across all my devices
**So that** I can seamlessly switch between phone, tablet, and computer

### Additional User Stories
1. **As a** mobile user, **I want** touch-optimized interactions, **so that** journaling on mobile feels natural
2. **As a** desktop user, **I want** keyboard shortcuts and efficient navigation, **so that** I can journal quickly on computer
3. **As a** tablet user, **I want** stylus support for handwritten notes, **so that** I can combine digital and handwritten elements
4. **As a** accessibility-conscious user, **I want** consistent accessibility features, **so that** I can use any device comfortably
