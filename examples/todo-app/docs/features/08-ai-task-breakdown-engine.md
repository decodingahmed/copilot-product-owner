# Feature 08: AI Task Breakdown Engine

**Epic:** [02-ai-assisted-task-planning](../epics/02-ai-assisted-task-planning.md)
**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** XL
**Assigned To:** TBD
**Dependencies:** [02-rapid-logging-interface](02-rapid-logging-interface.md), AI infrastructure setup

## Description

Implement an intelligent AI system that helps users break down complex, vague, or overwhelming tasks into specific, actionable sub-tasks. This addresses the core user pain point of having open-ended tasks that feel too large or undefined to start, transforming them into manageable action items that maintain momentum and progress.

The AI acts as a collaborative planning partner, offering structured breakdowns while preserving user agency and the intentional decision-making that makes bullet journaling effective.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a** bullet journal user with complex projects
**I want** AI to help break down overwhelming tasks into specific actions
**So that** I can start making progress instead of feeling paralyzed by complexity

### Additional User Stories
1. **As a** procrastinator, **I want** tasks broken into small, achievable steps, **so that** I can build momentum and avoid overwhelm
2. **As a** project manager, **I want** AI to suggest task dependencies and sequencing, **so that** I can plan more effectively
3. **As a** goal-oriented person, **I want** time estimates for each sub-task, **so that** I can plan my schedule realistically
4. **As a** control-conscious user, **I want** to modify or reject AI suggestions, **so that** I maintain ownership of my planning process

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AI can analyze vague tasks and suggest 3-7 specific, actionable sub-tasks
- [ ] Sub-task suggestions include estimated time requirements and difficulty levels
- [ ] Users can easily accept, modify, or reject individual sub-task suggestions
- [ ] AI learns from user modifications to improve future suggestions
- [ ] Task breakdown requests are processed within 3 seconds
- [ ] System works for various task categories (work, personal, creative, administrative)
- [ ] AI provides reasoning for its breakdown approach when requested
- [ ] Privacy is maintained - personal task content is handled securely
- [ ] Offline fallback provides basic task breakdown templates

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- OpenAI GPT-4 integration for complex task analysis
- Local machine learning models for common task patterns
- User feedback loop system for continuous improvement
- Caching layer for similar task breakdowns to reduce API costs
- Privacy-first design with minimal data retention

### APIs/Endpoints
```
POST /api/ai/task-breakdown - Request AI task breakdown
  Body: { taskDescription: string, context?: string, userPreferences?: object }
  Response: { subTasks: SubTask[], reasoning: string, confidence: number }

POST /api/ai/feedback - Submit user feedback on AI suggestions
  Body: { originalTask: string, suggestions: SubTask[], userActions: UserAction[] }

GET /api/ai/task-templates - Get common task breakdown templates
  Response: { templates: TaskTemplate[] }
```

### Data Model
```javascript
TaskBreakdownRequest {
  id: string,
  userId: string,
  originalTask: string,
  context: string,
  aiSuggestions: SubTask[],
  userActions: UserAction[],
  timestamp: Date
}

SubTask {
  id: string,
  description: string,
  estimatedMinutes: number,
  difficulty: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high',
  priority: number,
  dependencies: string[],
  tags: string[],
  aiConfidence: number
}

UserAction {
  type: 'accepted' | 'modified' | 'rejected' | 'reordered',
  subTaskId: string,
  modifications?: object,
  timestamp: Date
}
```

## UI/UX Considerations

**Breakdown Flow:**
1. User selects complex task and chooses "AI Breakdown"
2. Loading state shows AI is analyzing (with progress indication)
3. AI suggestions appear as expandable cards with edit options
4. User can drag to reorder, click to edit, or swipe to reject
5. Accepted sub-tasks are added to appropriate daily logs
6. Original task is updated to link to sub-tasks

**Visual Design:**
- Clean card-based layout for sub-task suggestions
- Visual confidence indicators (color coding or progress bars)
- Easy-to-use edit and rejection controls
- Clear distinction between AI suggestions and user modifications
- Smooth animations for task acceptance and integration

**Interaction Patterns:**
- Swipe gestures for quick accept/reject on mobile
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Bulk actions for multiple sub-tasks
- Undo functionality for accidental actions

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for AI integration and response parsing
- [ ] Integration tests with OpenAI API including error scenarios
- [ ] E2E tests for complete task breakdown workflows
- [ ] Performance tests for response time requirements
- [ ] Security tests for data privacy and API key protection
- [ ] User acceptance testing with various task complexity levels
- [ ] A/B testing for different UI approaches to suggestion presentation

## Dependencies

**Technical Dependencies:**
- OpenAI API integration and authentication
- Task storage system with relationships/hierarchy support

## Notes

**AI Training Considerations:**
- Use anonymous, aggregated user feedback to improve suggestions
- Implement few-shot learning with bullet journal-specific examples
- Consider fine-tuning on task breakdown patterns specific to productivity workflows

**Cost Management:**
- Cache similar task breakdowns to reduce API calls
- Implement usage limits per user to control costs
- Consider local AI models for simple, common task types
- Monitor and optimize prompt engineering for efficiency

**Privacy & Ethics:**
- Process personal task data with minimal retention
- Provide clear opt-out options for AI features
- Ensure AI suggestions don't introduce bias or inappropriate content
- Allow users to see and control what data is used for AI training
