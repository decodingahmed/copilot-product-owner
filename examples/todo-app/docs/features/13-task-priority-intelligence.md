# Feature 13: Task Priority Intelligence

**Epic:** [02-ai-assisted-task-planning](../epics/02-ai-assisted-task-planning.md)
**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** Low
**Estimated Effort:** M
**Assigned To:** TBD
**Dependencies:** [11-contextual-task-suggestions](11-contextual-task-suggestions.md)

## Description

Implement AI-powered priority assessment that analyzes task urgency, importance, deadlines, and personal patterns to suggest optimal task prioritization. This helps users focus on what matters most while maintaining their personal prioritization philosophy.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a** overwhelmed bullet journal user
**I want** AI to help identify which tasks are most important
**So that** I can focus my energy on what truly matters

### Additional User Stories
1. **As a** deadline-driven person, **I want** urgency calculations based on due dates, **so that** I never miss important deadlines
2. **As a** goal-focused person, **I want** priority based on goal alignment, **so that** I consistently work toward my objectives
3. **As a** energy-conscious person, **I want** priority suggestions based on my energy patterns, **so that** I tackle hard tasks when I'm fresh
4. **As a** autonomous planner, **I want** to override AI priority suggestions, **so that** I maintain control over my choices

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AI analyzes multiple factors: deadlines, goal alignment, effort required, dependencies
- [ ] Priority suggestions use clear visual indicators (high/medium/low with reasoning)
- [ ] System learns from user priority adjustments and patterns
- [ ] Integration with time estimation for realistic daily planning
- [ ] Consideration of user's historical productivity patterns and energy levels
- [ ] Ability to manually override and adjust AI priority suggestions
- [ ] Priority explanations help users understand the reasoning
- [ ] Bulk priority assignment for multiple tasks

## Technical Details

### Priority Algorithm
```javascript
PriorityAssessment {
  taskId: string,
  urgencyScore: number, // Based on deadlines and time-sensitivity
  importanceScore: number, // Based on goal alignment and impact
  effortScore: number, // Based on complexity and time estimation  
  energyRequirement: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high',
  dependencies: string[],
  finalPriority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low',
  confidence: number,
  reasoning: string
}

PriorityFactors {
  daysUntilDeadline: number,
  goalAlignmentScore: number,
  estimatedEffort: number,
  userEnergyPattern: object,
  taskComplexity: number,
  externalDependencies: number
}
```

### APIs/Endpoints
```
POST /api/priority/assess - Get priority assessment for task(s)
PUT /api/priority/adjust - Update priority based on user feedback
GET /api/priority/patterns - Get user priority patterns and statistics
POST /api/priority/bulk - Assess priority for multiple tasks
```

## Definition of Done
