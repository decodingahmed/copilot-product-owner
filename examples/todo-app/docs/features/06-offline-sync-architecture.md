# Feature 06: Offline Sync Architecture

**Epic:** [01-core-bullet-journal-infrastructure](../epics/01-core-bullet-journal-infrastructure.md)
**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** XL
**Assigned To:** TBD
**Dependencies:** [01-user-authentication-system](01-user-authentication-system.md)

## Description

Implement robust offline-first architecture ensuring bullet journal functionality works seamlessly without internet connection, with intelligent synchronization when connectivity returns. This is critical for daily journaling reliability and user trust.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a** bullet journal user
**I want** full functionality even without internet
**So that** I can always access and update my journal regardless of connectivity

### Additional User Stories
1. **As a** commuter, **I want** to journal on subway/airplane without connection, **so that** I never miss capturing thoughts
2. **As a** multi-device user, **I want** seamless sync when online, **so that** my entries appear everywhere without conflicts
3. **As a** data-conscious user, **I want** conflict resolution that preserves all my work, **so that** I never lose entries
4. **As a** reliability-focused user, **I want** immediate feedback on sync status, **so that** I know when my data is backed up

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Full app functionality available offline including entry creation, editing, and deletion
- [ ] Automatic background sync when connectivity restored
- [ ] Conflict resolution system for multi-device edits with user control
- [ ] Visual sync status indicators showing current synchronization state
- [ ] Local data persistence survives app crashes and device restarts
- [ ] Efficient sync protocol minimizing data usage and battery impact
- [ ] Backup and restore functionality for data protection
- [ ] Graceful handling of partial sync failures with retry mechanisms

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- SQLite local database with full app functionality
- Event-sourcing pattern for conflict-free replication
- Background sync with exponential backoff retry strategy
- Operational transformation for concurrent editing resolution

### APIs/Endpoints
```
POST /api/sync/push - Upload local changes
GET /api/sync/pull - Download remote changes since timestamp
POST /api/sync/resolve - Submit conflict resolution
GET /api/sync/status - Check sync status and conflicts
```

### Data Model
```javascript
SyncEvent {
  id: string,
  userId: string,
  eventType: 'create' | 'update' | 'delete',
  entityType: 'entry' | 'habit' | 'goal',
  entityId: string,
  data: object,
  timestamp: Date,
  deviceId: string,
  synced: boolean
}

ConflictResolution {
  conflictId: string,
  localVersion: object,
  remoteVersion: object,
  resolvedVersion: object,
  resolutionStrategy: 'merge' | 'local' | 'remote' | 'manual'
}
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Offline functionality complete and tested
- [ ] Sync mechanism working reliably
- [ ] Conflict resolution tested with various scenarios
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met for large datasets
- [ ] Multi-device testing completed successfully
