## Problem & Opportunity

### Q1: What specific problems with existing todo apps are you trying to solve with bullet journaling principles?
**Asked:** October 29, 2025
**Answer:** Focus on rapid logging and metrics that show progress towards goals. User has additional ideas to discuss later.
**Follow-up notes:** Core priorities identified: 1) Rapid logging functionality, 2) Goal progress metrics/visualization 

## Bullet Journal Integration

### Q2: What types of entries do you want for rapid logging?
**Asked:** October 29, 2025
**Answer:** Classic bullet journal symbols (â€¢, -, *, etc.) plus events, tasks, and notes
**Follow-up notes:** User wants traditional BuJo experience with digital enhancements

### Q3: What goal progress metrics are you envisioning?
**Asked:** October 29, 2025
**Answer:** Completion percentages, streaks (daily incremental progress), habit tracking, visual charts showing all of these metrics
**Follow-up notes:** Strong emphasis on visual progress tracking and daily momentum

### Q4: How do you currently track goals and tasks? What works/frustrates you?
**Asked:** October 29, 2025
**Answer:** Currently splits between Todoist and physical bullet journal. Daily process: copies relevant tasks from Todoist, WhatsApp, and previous day's entry to new day's entry. Likes the intentional thinking this requires but finds it effortful. Key pain points: 1) Loses track of future/upcoming tasks, 2) Wants to pre-plan birthdays/meetings/travel, 3) Has open-ended tasks that need AI help to flesh out, 4) Wants AI agents to do some work autonomously.
**Follow-up notes:** Current workflow shows value in intentional task selection but reveals need for better future planning and AI assistance. User sees potential for AI to enhance rather than replace the thoughtful aspects of bullet journaling.
