## Project Overview

### Vision Statement
Create a digital bullet journaling app that preserves the intentional, mindful aspects of traditional bullet journaling while adding AI-powered assistance for task planning, progress tracking, and future planning capabilities.

### Core Problems Solved
1. **Task Fragmentation:** Eliminates need to copy tasks between multiple systems (Todoist, WhatsApp, physical journal)
2. **Future Planning Gaps:** Provides proactive planning for upcoming events, birthdays, meetings, travel
3. **Open-ended Task Management:** AI assistance to break down vague tasks into actionable steps
4. **Progress Visibility:** Visual metrics and streaks to maintain momentum
5. **Cognitive Load:** AI agents handle routine planning while preserving intentional decision-making

### Success Criteria
- Reduces daily task organization time by 50% while maintaining thoughtful task selection
- Improves future task visibility and planning accuracy
- Increases goal completion rates through better progress tracking and AI assistance
- Maintains the meditative, intentional aspects that make bullet journaling effective

## Technical Architecture

### Recommended Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- React Native or Flutter for cross-platform mobile app
- Web Progressive Web App (PWA) for desktop access
- Offline-first architecture for reliable journaling

**Backend:**
- Node.js with Express or Python with FastAPI
- PostgreSQL for structured data (tasks, habits, goals)
- Vector database (Pinecone/Weaviate) for AI context and task history
- Redis for caching and real-time features

**AI Services:**
- OpenAI GPT-4 for task planning and suggestions
- Custom fine-tuned models for bullet journal-specific workflows
- Natural language processing for voice-to-text rapid logging
- Scheduling AI for calendar integration and future planning

**Infrastructure:**
- Cloud deployment (AWS/Azure/GCP)
- Containerized microservices architecture
- CI/CD pipeline for continuous deployment
- Mobile push notifications for reminders and AI suggestions

### Data Architecture
- User-centric design with local-first data synchronization
- Encrypted storage for personal journaling data
- API-first design for future integrations (Todoist, Google Calendar, etc.)
- Export capabilities (PDF, plain text) to prevent vendor lock-in

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| AI costs become prohibitive | High | Medium | Implement usage limits, tier-based pricing, local AI options |
| User adoption challenges | High | Medium | Focus on preserving familiar BuJo workflows, extensive user testing |
| Data privacy concerns | High | Low | End-to-end encryption, local-first architecture, clear privacy policy |
| Technical complexity overhead | Medium | High | Start with MVP, iterative development, modular architecture |
| AI suggestions feel intrusive | Medium | Medium | User-controlled AI levels, always preserve manual override options |
