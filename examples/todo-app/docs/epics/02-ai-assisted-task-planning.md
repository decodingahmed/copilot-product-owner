# Epic 02: AI-Assisted Task Planning

**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 6 weeks
**Dependencies:** Epic 01 (Core Infrastructure must be complete)

## Description

Integrate AI capabilities to enhance the bullet journaling experience by providing intelligent assistance for task planning, breakdown, and organization. This epic transforms vague, open-ended tasks into actionable, well-structured plans while preserving the user's agency and intentional decision-making process.

The AI acts as a collaborative partner, offering suggestions and breakdowns that users can accept, modify, or reject, ensuring the bullet journal remains a personal and thoughtful tool.

## Business Value

Provides the key differentiator that sets this app apart from traditional bullet journal apps:
- Transforms overwhelming tasks into manageable action items
- Reduces planning friction while maintaining intentional workflow
- Increases task completion rates through better structure
- Creates sticky engagement through personalized AI assistance

## Goals & Objectives

- Implement AI-powered task breakdown for complex or vague tasks
- Provide intelligent time estimation and scheduling suggestions
- Offer contextual task suggestions based on user history and patterns
- Create natural language processing for quick task entry
- Maintain user control and override capabilities for all AI suggestions

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AI can break down open-ended tasks into 3-7 actionable sub-tasks
- [ ] Time estimation suggestions are reasonably accurate (within 25% of actual)
- [ ] Natural language task entry works for 90% of common task formats
- [ ] AI suggestions can be easily accepted, modified, or dismissed
- [ ] System learns from user preferences and adjustments over time
- [ ] AI responses are generated within 3 seconds of request
- [ ] Privacy and data security maintained for all AI interactions

## Features in this Epic

## Technical Considerations

**AI Architecture:**
- OpenAI GPT-4 for complex task analysis and breakdown
- Local caching for common task patterns to reduce API costs
- User feedback loop for continuous AI improvement
- Fallback mechanisms when AI services are unavailable

**Privacy & Security:**
- On-device processing for sensitive personal information
- Anonymized data for AI training and improvement
- User consent for all AI data usage
- Clear data retention and deletion policies

**Performance:**
- Batch AI requests to optimize API usage
- Progressive enhancement - works without AI if needed
- Smart caching of AI responses for similar tasks

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| AI suggestions feel impersonal or irrelevant | High | Medium | Extensive personalization, user feedback integration |
| High AI API costs scaling with users | High | Medium | Local processing where possible, usage limits, tiered pricing |
| AI becomes too intrusive or overwhelming | Medium | Low | User-controlled AI levels, easy disable options |
| Privacy concerns with personal task data | Medium | Low | Local processing, clear privacy policies, user control |

## Success Metrics

- **AI Acceptance Rate:** 60%+ of AI task suggestions are accepted or modified (not rejected)
- **Task Completion Improvement:** 25% increase in task completion rates vs manual planning
- **User Satisfaction:** 4.5+ star rating for AI assistance features
- **Performance:** AI responses delivered within 3 seconds 95% of the time
- **Cost Efficiency:** AI costs remain under $2 per active user per month
