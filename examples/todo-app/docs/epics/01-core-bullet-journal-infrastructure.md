# Epic 01: Core Bullet Journal Infrastructure

**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 8 weeks
**Dependencies:** None (Foundation epic)

## Description

Establish the foundational bullet journaling system that replicates the core analog experience digitally. This epic focuses on creating the essential rapid logging, migration, and organizational structures that make bullet journaling effective, while building the technical foundation for future AI enhancements.

This epic represents the MVP that users can immediately use as a digital replacement for their physical bullet journal, maintaining all the key workflows and mental models they're accustomed to.

## Business Value

Creates the core product that users can immediately adopt, providing:
- Digital convenience while preserving analog bullet journal workflows
- Solid foundation for all future AI and advanced features
- Immediate value for existing bullet journal practitioners
- Technical infrastructure that supports scalable growth

## Goals & Objectives

- Implement complete rapid logging system with traditional BuJo symbols
- Create intuitive daily, weekly, and monthly log interfaces
- Enable seamless task migration between time periods
- Establish secure user accounts and data synchronization
- Build offline-first architecture for reliable journaling

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can create and manage bullet journal entries with standard symbols (â€¢, -, *, etc.)
- [ ] Daily logs support tasks, events, and notes with proper categorization
- [ ] Monthly and weekly overview pages function correctly
- [ ] Task migration works smoothly between daily logs
- [ ] User authentication and data persistence work reliably
- [ ] App functions completely offline with sync when online
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility (mobile + web) is maintained

## Technical Considerations

**Architecture Decisions:**
- Offline-first design with conflict resolution for multi-device sync
- Component-based UI architecture for consistent bullet journal elements
- Local database with cloud backup for data security

**Key Technologies:**
- React Native for cross-platform mobile development
- SQLite for local storage with sync capabilities
- End-to-end encryption for user data protection

**Performance Requirements:**
- Sub-200ms response time for rapid logging interactions
- Seamless offline operation with background sync
- Efficient data structures for large journal histories

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Users find digital version less satisfying than analog | High | Medium | Extensive user testing, preserve all analog workflows |
| Cross-platform consistency issues | Medium | Medium | Shared component library, automated testing |
| Data sync conflicts in multi-device usage | Medium | Low | Robust conflict resolution, user-friendly merge options |
| Performance issues with large journal histories | Medium | Low | Efficient pagination, data archiving strategies |

## Success Metrics

- **User Adoption:** 80% of test users can complete daily logging workflow within first session
- **Engagement:** Average 5+ journal entries per active user per day
- **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime for core logging functionality
- **Performance:** <200ms response time for all rapid logging actions
- **Cross-platform:** Feature parity maintained across mobile and web platforms
