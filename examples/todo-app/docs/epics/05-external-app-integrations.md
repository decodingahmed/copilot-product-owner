# Epic 05: External App Integrations

**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** 4 weeks
**Dependencies:** Epic 01 (Core Infrastructure)

## Description

Eliminate task fragmentation across multiple platforms by creating seamless integrations with popular productivity and communication apps. This epic addresses the current pain point of manually copying tasks from Todoist, WhatsApp, and other sources into the bullet journal, while preserving the intentional selection process that makes bullet journaling effective.

The integration maintains user agency in task selection while dramatically reducing the friction of gathering tasks from various sources into a unified bullet journal workflow.

## Business Value

Solves a major workflow inefficiency identified in user research:
- Reduces daily task consolidation time from 15-30 minutes to 2-3 minutes
- Increases user adoption by working with existing productivity ecosystems
- Creates competitive moat through comprehensive integration support
- Maintains bullet journal philosophy while adding modern convenience

## Goals & Objectives

- Implement bidirectional sync with major task management apps (Todoist, Any.do, etc.)
- Create smart task import from messaging apps (WhatsApp, Slack, email)
- Build intelligent task detection and suggestion system
- Develop unified inbox for task suggestions from all sources
- Maintain user control and intentional selection in all integrations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Tasks from integrated apps appear as suggestions, not automatic imports
- [ ] Users can quickly review and select relevant tasks for their daily log
- [ ] Integration setup is simple and secure (OAuth where possible)
- [ ] Task context and metadata are preserved during import
- [ ] Completed tasks can optionally sync back to source apps
- [ ] Integration works reliably with minimal performance impact
- [ ] Users maintain full control over what gets imported and when

## Features in this Epic

- [26-todoist-integration](../features/26-todoist-integration.md)
- [27-messaging-app-task-detection](../features/27-messaging-app-task-detection.md)
- [28-email-task-extraction](../features/28-email-task-extraction.md)
- [29-unified-task-suggestion-inbox](../features/29-unified-task-suggestion-inbox.md)
- [30-integration-management-dashboard](../features/30-integration-management-dashboard.md)

## Technical Considerations

**Integration Architecture:**
- OAuth-based authentication for secure app connections
- Webhook and polling systems for real-time task updates
- API rate limiting and error handling for external service reliability
- Modular integration framework for easy addition of new services

**Data Processing:**
- Natural language processing for task detection in messages and emails
- Intelligent deduplication to avoid duplicate task suggestions
- Metadata preservation and mapping between different app formats
- Privacy-conscious data handling with minimal storage of external data

**Performance & Reliability:**
- Background processing for integration updates to avoid UI blocking
- Graceful degradation when external services are unavailable
- Efficient caching to minimize API calls and improve response times
- Robust error handling and user-friendly error messages

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| External API changes breaking integrations | Medium | High | Versioned API usage, fallback mechanisms, monitoring systems |
| User privacy concerns with app access | High | Low | Minimal permissions, clear privacy policy, user control |
| Integration complexity overwhelming users | Medium | Medium | Simple setup wizard, progressive disclosure, optional features |
| Performance impact from multiple integrations | Medium | Low | Background processing, rate limiting, user-controlled sync frequency |

## Success Metrics

- **Time Savings:** 80% reduction in daily task consolidation time
- **Integration Adoption:** 70% of users connect at least one external app
- **Task Flow:** 60% of daily tasks come through integration suggestions
- **User Satisfaction:** 4.2+ star rating for integration features
- **Reliability:** 99.5% uptime for integration processing with 95% successful sync rate
