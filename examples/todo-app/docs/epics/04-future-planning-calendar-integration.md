# Epic 04: Future Planning & Calendar Integration

**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** 6 weeks
**Dependencies:** Epic 01 (Core Infrastructure), Epic 02 (AI Task Planning)

## Description

Solve the critical problem of losing track of future tasks and events by implementing proactive planning capabilities. This epic enables users to effectively plan for birthdays, meetings, travel, and other future events while maintaining the bullet journal's present-focused philosophy with enhanced forward-thinking support.

The system acts as an intelligent planning assistant that surfaces relevant future considerations at the right time, helping users prepare without becoming overwhelmed by distant obligations.

## Business Value

Addresses a major pain point identified in user research:
- Eliminates the stress and missed opportunities from forgotten future events
- Provides competitive advantage over traditional bullet journal methods
- Increases user reliance and daily engagement with the app
- Creates opportunities for AI-assisted event preparation and planning

## Goals & Objectives

- Implement intelligent future event detection and reminder system
- Create seamless calendar integration for comprehensive event management
- Build proactive planning assistance for complex events (travel, meetings, birthdays)
- Develop smart notification system that respects bullet journal mindfulness principles
- Enable advanced planning workflows while maintaining daily focus

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] System automatically surfaces relevant future events during daily planning
- [ ] Calendar integration works bidirectionally with major calendar services
- [ ] AI provides helpful preparation suggestions for different event types
- [ ] Notifications are timely, relevant, and can be customized by user preferences
- [ ] Future planning doesn't overwhelm daily bullet journal workflow
- [ ] Recurring events and birthdays are handled intelligently
- [ ] Travel and meeting preparation workflows are intuitive and comprehensive

## Technical Considerations

**Integration Architecture:**
- Calendar API integration (Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar)
- Event parsing and intelligent categorization systems
- Notification scheduling and delivery infrastructure
- Time zone handling for travel and remote events

**AI Planning Engine:**
- Event type classification and preparation template matching
- Personalized planning suggestion algorithms
- Learning from user preparation patterns and preferences
- Integration with external APIs for event-specific information (weather, locations, etc.)

**Data Management:**
- Future event storage and indexing for quick retrieval
- Privacy-conscious handling of calendar data
- Efficient synchronization with minimal battery impact
- Conflict resolution for overlapping events and tasks

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Calendar integration privacy concerns | High | Low | Clear permissions, minimal data access, user control |
| Notification fatigue overwhelming users | Medium | Medium | Smart frequency limits, user customization, learning algorithms |
| Complex events too difficult for AI to plan effectively | Medium | Medium | Human-AI collaboration, template-based fallbacks |
| Calendar sync conflicts and data loss | High | Low | Robust conflict resolution, backup systems, user confirmation |

## Success Metrics

- **Future Event Success:** 90% of future events are successfully detected and planned for
- **Preparation Effectiveness:** 60% reduction in forgotten event preparations
- **Calendar Integration:** 80% of users connect at least one external calendar
- **User Satisfaction:** 4.3+ star rating for future planning features
- **Notification Quality:** Less than 5% of notifications marked as irrelevant or spam
