This folder contains the output from an example "Todo-List App" project generated using Copilot.

The initial prompt was:
```
I want to create a todo app that uses bullet journaling to keep track of progress and helps me plan forward with upcoming tasks.
```

Then, I answered the questions that asked. See [`/docs/discovery/questions-and-answers.md`](./docs/discovery/questions-and-answers.md).

Once Copilot has finished asking me questions, it asked me if I wanted to generate a development plan. See [`/docs/planning/development-plan.md`](./docs/planning/development-plan)

Then, it asked if I wanted to generate epics and features. See content under `/epics` and `/features`.
