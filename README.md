# Copilot Product Owner

Transform GitHub Copilot into your AI Product Owner assistant. This tool helps you take product ideas from concept to comprehensive, structured documentation through intelligent conversation and systematic planning. Additionally, it allows you to review your plan written in Markdown files before using GitHub MCP server to make your plan actionable with a development team.

## 🎯 What This Tool Does

This AI Product Owner Tool leverages GitHub Copilot to act as your intelligent product manager, helping you:

- **💡 Define & Refine Ideas** - Ask targeted questions to clarify and strengthen your product concept
- **📝 Document Discovery** - Automatically save all questions and answers in structured Q&A format
- **📋 Create Development Plans** - Generate comprehensive plans with technical architecture and timelines
- **📦 Organize into Epics** - Break your product into logical epics with clear business value
- **✨ Detail Features** - Create numbered feature specifications with user stories and acceptance criteria
- **🔄 Maintain Context** - Never lose important details through systematic documentation. Extend Copilot's context across VSCode or Chat sessions with the most relevant information.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Present Your Idea
Simply start talking to GitHub Copilot about your product idea:

```
"I want to build a task management app"
"I have an idea for a learning platform"  
"I'm thinking about creating a developer tool"
```

### 2. Engage in Discovery
Copilot will ask clarifying questions covering:
- **Problem & Solution**: What are you solving?
- **Target Users**: Who will use this?
- **Key Features**: What capabilities are needed?
- **Technical Constraints**: Any specific requirements?
- **Success Criteria**: How will you measure success?

*All Q&A is automatically saved to `docs/discovery/questions-and-answers.md`.*

### 3. Get Your Structured Plan
Receive comprehensive documentation including:
- Development plan with timeline and architecture
- Organized epics with business value
- Detailed features with user stories
- Technical implementation guidance

```
